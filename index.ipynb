    "    1. Microphones/Condenser loudspeakers: The membrane that moves / produces the sound waves is solidary to one of the faces of a condenser that when moving with the sound, modifies its capacity, and this is registered electrically. On the loudspeaker the incoming variable intensity electricity causes the faces to attract or repel each other.\n",
    "    2. Microphones/Coil loudspeakers: The membrane is integral with a coil that moves inside / produces a magnetic field. In the micro, when moving, an electric current is induced. In the loudspeaker, the electric current causes the coil to move and with it the membrane.\n",
    "    3. Microphones/Piezoelectric speakers: In the micro the membrane moves a piezoelectric material1. In the loudspeaker, the pizoelectric material contracts or expands depending on the intensity of current that passes through it."
